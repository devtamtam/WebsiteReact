This is my very first react project.
I am just tryna getting used to this stuff by playing around..


my notes are following..

use vite@latest instead of react-app which is outdated

√ Select a framework: » React
√ Select a variant: » TypeScript

start  http://localhost:5173/

tp restart the server:
get to "my-react-app" folder and run
'npm run dev' 


tsx files bcs I chose ts instead of js?
combination of ts and html? 


importing App to main.tsx
